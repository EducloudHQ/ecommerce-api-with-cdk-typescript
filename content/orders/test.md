# Deployment

Firstly, Let's deploy the application.

```
npm run dev
```
This command runs and deploys our application and provides the endpoint url.


## Place order

Let's place an order by providing the user id.

Still in postman, change the path to `/cart/test@gmail.com/checkout`

`test@gmail.com` is the id of the user.


Request method is `POST`

There isn't any request body
