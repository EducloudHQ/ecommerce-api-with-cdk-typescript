## Install the AWS SST


To install the Serverless Stack (SST), you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have these installed, you can install the SST using npm:

```
npm install -g sst

```

This will install the SST globally on your machine. You can then proceed to create and deploy AWS infrastructure as code.

For more information on getting started with the Serverless Stack, including setting up your AWS credentials and creating your first SST app, see the [official SST documentation](https://sst.dev).
