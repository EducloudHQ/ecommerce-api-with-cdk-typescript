# Conclusion

In this course, we built and e-commerce api to handle user orders using single table design with DynamoDB.

**Key points**

The single table design makes it easy to store and query data.

The SQS queue and Lambda function provide a way to decouple the API from the underlying data store.

The DynamoDB table and DynamoDB stream provide a way to store and track changes to the data.
