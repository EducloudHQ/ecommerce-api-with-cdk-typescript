# General Overview

This course provides a detailed and hands on guide for building an E-commerce API with an event-driven architecture and a single table database design.

## Key Features

**Event-Driven Architecture**

An event-driven architecture is a design pattern in which the flow of data is driven by events. In this architecture, events are generated by services and consumed by other services. This approach is particularly useful for Ecommerce APIs, as it allows for real-time processing of data.

**Single Table Design**

In a single table design, all data for a particular entity is stored in a single table. This approach is useful for Ecommerce APIs, as it simplifies the database design and enables faster queries.

## AWS Services used

**API GATEWAY**

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With Amazon API Gateway, you only pay when your APIs are in use. There are no minimum fees or upfront commitments

**AWS Lambda** 

 AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use. Cost of using lambda functions.

**Amazon Simple Queue Service**

Simple Queue Service (SQS) is an AWS service that provides a fully managed message queuing service for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. A queue is a data structure in computer science that stores and manages a list of elements in a specific order. Elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front of the queue, following a "first in, first out" (FIFO) protocol.

**Amazon Dynamodb**

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It is designed to handle large amounts of data and traffic, and provides low-latency read and write performance at any scale.

Taking this course will give learners practical knowledge and good understanding on:
- When to use single table design
- How to implement single table design in dynamodb.
- Amazon SQS.
- What queues are and how they function.
- Amazon API Gateway
- Amazon lambda function
- The basics of event driven architecture.
- Dynamodb
