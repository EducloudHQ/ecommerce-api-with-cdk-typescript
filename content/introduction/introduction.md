# Welcome to the E-commerce Rest Api with Single Table Design.

## Concept

In this course, we'll use Serverless Stack to build a system where customers can:

- Add product to cart.
- Order products.
- View their order history.
- Keep track of their carts.

We'll build and deploy a serverless API with SST Typescript.

## Prerequisites
Install these dependencies before proceeding.

- AWS CLI
- AWS ACCOUNT AND USER
- Node Js
- AWS CDK ToolKit


## Building the Ecommerce API

To build the Ecommerce API with event-driven architecture and single table design, follow these steps:

1. Define the events that will be generated by the Ecommerce API. These events may include new order created, order shipped, and order canceled.
2. Build the services that will generate and consume events. These services should be designed to communicate with one another through the event bus.
3. Create a single table for storing all data related to orders. This table should include columns for order ID, user ID, product ID, order status, and order date.
4. Build the API endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting orders. These endpoints should communicate with the order service to generate the appropriate events.
5. Implement the event handlers for the events generated by the dynamodb table. These event handlers should update the order table and perform necessary actions, such as changing the status of every product in the cart from PENDING to ORDERED.
6. Test the Ecommerce API to ensure that it's functioning as expected.

These steps will build a robust E-commerce API with event-driven architecture and single table design.
